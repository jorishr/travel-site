#Travel-Site

#Description

Website built to practice with CSS/JS file architecture, BEM naming conventions,
Git, NPM, PostCSS, Webpack, Gulp and the deployment process.

#Customization

- The original project is built relies heavily on gulp-postCSS. I decided to use gulp-SASS as requires less dependencies.
- folder structure
